# OSM RTK Collection tool

A tool to collect osm data with the help of a ublox rtx receiver.

my current setup is a ublox `ZED-F9P` connected via usb to raspberry pi 3b that is connected to a mobile hotspot of my ipad. The ipad then will connect to the webapp.

this is mainly build for a project where i wanna map my town in far more detail than you could with Satellite imagery (while learning how that all works). Where probably the raw data and a QGIS file will be made public. And a subset of that data will be used to improve the OSM dataset. So truely open data ^^

## Note

this is more of a "i share my stuff, so you adapt it to your own needs" project (aka no support or what so ever)
